Enter the following Remote Git repository HTTPS URL: `https://github.com/hawka97/csm.git`, then populate your GitHub username and password and click Setup remote workspace. 

## Making Changes and Contributing
In MCreator, before making changes, you need to sync your workspace. Click the blue down arrow in the upper right toolbar. Watch the status bar at the bottom of the screen. If the pull is complete, you will see a message such as "Synced to remote workspace. Local workspace was X changes ahead and X changes behind"

__NOTE:__ It is common for MCreator to not pull the changes. Make sure to verify it pulls the latest changes. The SYNC option usually works better than the PULL option, so the SYNC option is recommended where possible.
