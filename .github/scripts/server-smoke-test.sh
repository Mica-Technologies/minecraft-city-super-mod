# Boot a dedicated server via `./gradlew runServer` and assert it reaches "Done (".
#
# Why this exists: mod code that compiles fine can still be impossible to load on a
# dedicated server — a client-only class referenced from common code, a client mod
# declared as a hard dependency, a Side.CLIENT packet handler that touches Minecraft
# directly. Forge only catches those at server startup, so `./gradlew build` is
# perfectly happy right up until production dies. SUM shipped three such bugs at once
# bugs at once in 2026.07.19 and took the Alto server down; every one of them was
# reachable from a single server boot.
#
# `runServer` never returns on success, so we background it, tail the log for a verdict,
# then shut it down.
#
# Env:
#   SMOKE_TIMEOUT   seconds to wait for startup (default 900)
#   SMOKE_LOG       log file path (default server-smoke.log)
#   GRADLE_ARGS     extra arguments for the runServer line (default none). The mod ships as a
#                   mandatory Core jar plus optional module jars, so `-PcsmRunModules=core`
#                   boots the server with Core alone — the cheapest check that Core has not
#                   grown a dependency on something only a module jar carries.
