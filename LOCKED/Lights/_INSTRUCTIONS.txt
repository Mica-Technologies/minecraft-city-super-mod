1:

	Replace all code from below the getBoundingBox method to 
	above the isOpaqueCube method with the code in `Code.txt` 
	(See Below for More Information)


2:

	Modify the blockstate to follow the blockstate in `Blockstate.txt`







1 -- CONTINUED: 

	There should be four methods that are replaced with the code from `Code.txt`. 
	They are createBlockState(), getStateFromMeta(int), 
	getMetaFromState(IBlockState) and 
	getStateForPlacement(Word,BlockPos,EnumFacing,float,float,float,int,EntityLivingBase)
